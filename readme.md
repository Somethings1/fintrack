Your AI finance tracker
---

# Disclaimer
This is my first app in the full-stack dev journey. I've got several projects
in progress, and all of them have gone to the ultimate trash can of the
universe of programming. So, in order to make this a difference, I'm going to
conmmit evrything to github, so I can keep track of my progress. This readme.md
was created the same time I got this idea, so i can actually measure the time
it took to finish this project.

This readme file will be updated several times.

# Tech stack

The tech stack of this app is (hopefully):

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend
- [Golang](https://golang.org/) for the backend
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database

No, I don't know what I'm doing. I don't even know anything above. I don't even
know anything about web development. Everything I did was some stupid JavaFX
thingies and called it a day. However, this should end. Hopefully, in a month
or two, I can finish this project.

# Description

What every user expect from an AI finance tracker? Yes, create transactions
records and see the summary. There will be a mobile version using React Native
and a web version (hopefully we can convert those components to web). In every
version, user can create transaction records by voice, the data will then be
translated into a transaction record using an AI model, then stored in the
database. The app will then show the records and the summary. Of course, user
can fill the transaction records manually as well.

So, with that being said, let's hop into it, tomorrow. And, hopefully, there
will be an exact same app, with completely different tech stack, in another
month or two, so I can see how fast I learn new techs.
